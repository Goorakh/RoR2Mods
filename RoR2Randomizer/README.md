# Risk of Rain 2 Randomizer

A randomizer mod for Risk of Rain 2!

It is *highly* recommended to take a look over the mod config before starting a run. By default almost all randomizers are enabled, which is utter chaos, which you may or may not want.

Because I'm such a narcissist, this mod has a dedicated [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/29PTeWaKCj)! Join if you're into that.

Current Features:
* Multiplayer Compatible. Every player needs to have the mod.
* Compatibile with Risk of Options for easy configuration in-game.
* Consistent Randomness: The way things are randomized is consistent throughout a run. A certain randomized replacement (item, summon, buff, etc.) will always be the same until the run ends.

Current Randomizers:
* Stage Randomizer: Swaps every stage for a random playable map.
* Boss Randomizer: Randomizes the character types of bosses. Currently includes [Mithrix](https://youtu.be/EZLbivjyFMk), [Voidling](https://youtu.be/HAH9Rxyl2lU), Aurelionite, Twisted Scavengers, Alloy Worship Unit and Teleporter Bosses.
